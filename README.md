# eigo_AI
A pet project; an AI assistant for assisting ESL learners do curriculum-accurate homework without their primary teacher or english native present to help them

The project has 3 objectives:
1) Set up a website or app (HTML/CSS) that will make up the effective user interface (consider using tailwind CSS for smoother layout)
2) Set up javascript that lets the user interact with the AI via backend calls, as well as maintains smooth connection between the other functionality documents.
3) develop a database that sidelines the students progress and interactions with the AI with curriculum accurate lessons and homework, and create functional code that moves the data between the website and database (python and likely javascript)
